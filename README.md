# clj-gradle

A Clojure/Java/Kotlin template.

You should be able to just import this into Intellij IDEA and work on Java/Kotlin.

To get a Clojure REPL you need to run
```bash
./gradlew clojureRepl
```
and then connect via your favourite editor. You can then import Java and Kotlin classes as needed. See [example.clj](lib/src/main/clojure/org/example.clj) for examples.
